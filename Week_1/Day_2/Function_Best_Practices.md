## Conventions for Naming Functions
Although this topic is fairly subjective, and often contentious among opinionated developers, `function (and variable) naming is an important art`. Since it directly affects the readability of your code, you should get into

* avoid generic names like 'data', or 'run'
* name your functions beginning with `action words` like createUser, or sendUserData
* be `consistent` with your naming conventions
* if you're joining an existing project, `observe and adapt` any existing conventions
* These are not hard rules that you can apply universally. Your personal style will evolve with experience.

## Best Practices for Functions

* Give your functions precise verb/action based names
* Use camelCasedNames (like this one)
* Properly indent the function code
* `Functions should focus on a single task: returning a value or causing a side effect.` Break your function into additional smaller functions if you find it doing two or more things
